🏫 I'm currently an undergraduate student at [Cornell CS](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/).

🔬 My undergraduate research interests are in computer vision and graphics. I'm also a member of Cornell University Artificial Intelligence ([CUAI](https://cuai.github.io/)).

🎾 I'm also a big gym guy, a eight ball player, and a badminton enthusiast.
